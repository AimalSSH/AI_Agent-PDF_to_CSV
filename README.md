# AI Agent - PDF to CSV
AI Agent that extracts the necessary information from a PDF file for the user and converts it into CSV format

## How to launch
Go to two directories:
   1. AI_Agent-PDF_to_CSV/config/ai_config.yaml
   2. AI_Agent-PDF_to_CSV/core/config/ai_config.yaml

There are two configuration files here that we need to add to the graph `api_key: ""` You can get your own key on the website https://openrouter.ai/

You can choose a model ` model: "deepseek/deepseek-chat"`, The default value is `deepseek/deepseek-chat`

Next, you need to run the file `main.py`. 

P.S. I'll create all the installation packages later, but for now, you'll have to download them yourself.
